cityscape
=========

This is the code that accompanies a long series of blog posts about writing a night-time programmatically generated
cityscape. That's probably a better place to start, if you're interested: http://blog.parm.net/?cat=42

(the original posts link to a Bazaar repo that's no longer there; hopefully the revision numbers should still correspond,
though)
